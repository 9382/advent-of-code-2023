A collection of (some) solutions to the [2023 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023), done in a mix of python and lua

Each script has a post-completion explanation to help understand the final code a bit better

## Incomplete Days
* Day 12 part 2 - A challenge of optimisation that I'm not able to think of a reliable solution for. I have some ideas, but they most definitely won't fully fix the issue.
* Day 17 part 1 - Don't immediately see a simple way to optimise this. That combined with lower motivation means I'm likely not solving this one
* Day 18 part 2 - I managed to actually create a solution that could theoretically handle the scale of the puzzle, but it generates the wrong (too low) answer for only the final dataset (works for all the testcases). Considering its unfeasable for me to debug the mess that is the solution, this is remaining incomplete (though I have included the code)
* Day 20 part 2 - I've got an idea, I'm just yet to get it down as code. Not too sure if it'll work
* Day 21 part 2 - No thanks
* Day 22 - Not attempted
* Day 23 - Not attempted
* Day 24 part 2 - No good ideas
* Day 25 - Not attempted
